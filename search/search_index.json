LANs are typically privately owned and managed.</p> <p>WLAN (wireless local area network): A WLAN is the same as a LAN, but connections between network devices are made wirelessly.</p> <p>WAN (wide area network): As the name implies, a WAN connects computers over a wide area, for example from region to region or even continent to continent. The Internet is the largest WAN.</p> <p>MAN (metropolitan area network): MANs are typically larger than LANs, but smaller than WANs. MANs are typically owned and managed by cities and government entities.</p> <p>PAN (personal area network): A PAN serves a single person. For example, if you have an iPhone and a Mac, chances are you have set up a PAN that shares and syncs content - text messages, emails, photos, etc.</p> <p>SAN (storage area network): A SAN is a specialized network that provides access to block-level storage - shared network or cloud storage - that, to the user, looks and functions like a storage unit physically attached to a computer.</p> <p>CAN (campus area network): A CAN is also known as a corporate area network. A CAN is larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN. CANs serve sites such as schools, universities and corporate campuses.</p> <p>VPN (virtual private network): A VPN is a secure point-to-point connection between two network endpoints (see \"Nodes\" below). A VPN establishes an encrypted channel that keeps the user's identity and login credentials, as well as transferred data, inaccessible to hackers.</p>"},{"location":"computerNetworks/computerNetworks/#topics","title":"Topics","text":""},{"location":"cybersecurity/cybersecurity/","title":"Cybersecurity","text":"<p>This is the section on computer security.

This allows users to intercept and modify HTTP and HTTPS requests and responses sent between the browser and the server. The Proxy is also useful for vulnerability identification, as it allows users to examine traffic and analyze requests and responses.</li> <li>Scanner**: An automated vulnerability testing tool used to identify vulnerabilities in web applications. The Scanner uses advanced scanning techniques to detect web application vulnerabilities such as SQL injections, cross-site scripting (XSS), application layer security vulnerabilities (OSWAP Top 10) and more.</li> <li>Repeater: A tool that allows users to resend and replay HTTP and HTTPS requests. This is useful for testing different inputs and verifying server response. It is also useful for vulnerability identification, as it allows users to test different values and detect unexpected responses.</li> <li>Intruder: This is a tool used to automate brute force attacks. Users can define different payloads for different parts of the request, such as the URL, request body and headers. Intruder then automates the execution of the requests using different payloads and users can examine the responses to identify vulnerabilities.</li> <li>Comparer**: A tool used to compare two HTTP or HTTPS requests. This is useful for detecting differences between requests and responses and analyzing the security of the application.</li> </ul> <p>It is an extremely powerful tool, which can be used to identify a wide variety of security vulnerabilities in web applications. By using the different tools that make up BurpSuite, users can identify vulnerabilities in an automated or manual way, depending on their needs.

It improves posture, reduces wrist pain and, if you get the hang of it, you can even type faster.</p> <p>Then there are the switches. There is a great variety: linear, tactile, clicky... and the best thing is that you can lubricate them to your liking so they feel exactly the way you want them to. If you are detail-oriented, this is a marvel.</p> <p>Another advantage is the aesthetics. You can make it as minimalist or as colorful as you want. Although for me that's secondary compared to what's really powerful: advanced features.</p> <p>With a custom keyboard you can use layers, macros, and reassign any key. Do you want to hold down the space bar to activate other symbols? A shortcut to copy, paste or open the browser? Also. All this with firmwares like QMK or VIA.</p> <p>In short, a keyboard like this is an extension of the way you work and your personality.
