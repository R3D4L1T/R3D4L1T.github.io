The Proxy is also useful for vulnerability identification, as it allows users to examine traffic and analyze requests and responses.</li> <li>Scanner**: An automated vulnerability testing tool used to identify vulnerabilities in web applications. The Scanner uses advanced scanning techniques to detect web application vulnerabilities such as SQL injections, cross-site scripting (XSS), application layer security vulnerabilities (OSWAP Top 10) and more.</li> <li>Repeater: A tool that allows users to resend and replay HTTP and HTTPS requests. This is useful for testing different inputs and verifying server response. It is also useful for vulnerability identification, as it allows users to test different values and detect unexpected responses.</li> <li>Intruder: This is a tool used to automate brute force attacks. Users can define different payloads for different parts of the request, such as the URL, request body and headers.
